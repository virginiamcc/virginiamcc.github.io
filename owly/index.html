          <h2>Expert Berry Forager</h2>
          <p>Around the Lower Mainland, there is no other owl that is more knowledgeable about berries. Together with Quatchi, Owly practices foraging every night.</p>
          <p>I suppose I'll have to kill the Mountain myself. All dwarfs may be bastards yet not all bastards are dwarfs. It's too soon to know if you deserve my service. I'm no king, but I think there's more to ruling than that. If you want justice, you've come to the wrong place.
  I'm short not blind. The powerful have always preyed on the powerless, that's how they became powerful in the first place. I am not questioning your honor, I am denying its existence. If you want justice, you've come to the wrong place. My sister has mistaken me for a mushroom. She keeps me in the dark and feeds me shit.</p>
